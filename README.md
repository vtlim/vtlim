### 👋 Hi! I'm Victoria

I write docs. My past identities include computational chemistry researcher and patent technical specialist. My GitHub repos generally pertain to one of those three topics--tech writing, science, or patents.

#### 📝 Technical writing

* [docs-topics](https://github.com/vtlim/docs-topics): (private) natural language processing and topic modeling of internal forums to identify areas for docs improvement (happy to share a redacted version ✉️)
* [tech-docs](https://github.com/vtlim/tech-docs): scripts for docs-as-code technical writing, docs infrastructure, and technical exploration notebooks

#### 🔬 Science

* [plot_potential](https://github.com/vtlim/plot_potential): visualize functions that comprise molecular mechanics force fields (__ideal for presentations__)
* [misc](https://github.com/vtlim/misc): basic stats and plots (__used for [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=aGYEEPUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works)__);  configuration for Grace and VMD; OpenEye OEChem utilities
* [dihedral-scan](https://github.com/vtlim/dihedral-scan): determine the potential energy function of a dihedral angle in a molecule using NAMD
* [benchmarkff](https://github.com/MobleyLab/benchmarkff): comparison of optimized geometries and energies from various force fields with respect to a QM reference
* [off_psi4](https://github.com/vtlim/off_psi4): quantum mechanical analysis of molecular conformers (moved to [MobleyLab/quanformer](https://github.com/MobleyLab/quanformer))
* [permeability](https://github.com/vtlim/permeability): data analysis from NAMD simulations on calculating membrane permeabilities
* [GLIC](https://github.com/vtlim/GLIC): analysis and visualization for cryo-EM density-fitting simluations using GROMACS
* [Hv1](https://github.com/vtlim/Hv1): setup and analysis of free energy perturbation calculations of the Hv1 protein using NAMD
* [mismatch](https://github.com/vtlim/mismatch): web app to find mismatched base pairs between hybridized DNA sequences

#### 🌎  Patents

* [patfam](https://github.com/vtlim/patfam): web app for analysis of patent families across different jurisdictions (collaborations welcome! 👯)
* [textsmoosh](https://github.com/vtlim/textsmoosh): web app to process and combine multi-line text into a single line
* [excel](https://github.com/vtlim/excel): (private) scripts for Microsoft Excel to automate processing of datasets with thousands of compounds
